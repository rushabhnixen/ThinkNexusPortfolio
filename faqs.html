Typically, our AI development process includes: initial discovery (1-2 weeks) to define objectives and assess data availability; proof of concept (2-4 weeks) to validate the approach and demonstrate potential value; data preparation and model development (1-3 months) to clean data, train models, and iteratively improve performance; integration and testing (2-4 weeks) to incorporate the AI system into your product and validate its performance; and deployment and monitoring (ongoing) to maintain and improve the AI system over time. Think Nexus prioritizes early demonstrations of value, allowing you to see tangible results before full-scale implementation.</p>
